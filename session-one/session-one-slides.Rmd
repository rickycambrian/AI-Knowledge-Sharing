# Agenda

- Share concrete tips and recommendations for individuals and organizations
- Identify solutions to implement now and areas for future resources

# New Tools and Updates

## OpenAI Agents SDK
- Enables creation of autonomous agents with defined goals
- Supports asynchronous execution and multi-agent communication

## OpenAI Agents SDK - Handoffs

```{python}
from agents import Agent, handoff
# example specialized billing and refund agents
billing_agent = Agent(name="Billing agent")
refund_agent = Agent(name="Refund agent")
# Triage agent that can handoff to billing and refund agents
triage_agent = Agent(name="Triage agent", handoffs=[billing_agent, handoff(refund_agent)])
```

## OpenAI Real Time Voice
```{r}
knitr::include_url("http://localhost:3000/")
```

## OpenAI Insights
- Moving away from traditional chat interface
- Deep Research capabilities (mixed results)
- ChatGPT 4.5 not optimal for coding tasks

## Dify
- Dify 1.0 release 
- New agentic workflows and marketplace
- Customizable applications with low/no-code interface

# Claude Code - Usage Tips

## Tip 1: Easily Reset Context
- Manage context efficiently with structured documentation
- Key locations:
  - README.md: project documentation
  - CLAUDE.md: Claude-specific instructions
  - ai_docs (optional): specialized documentation
- Reset with: `Read README.md, CLAUDE.md, ai_docs folder contents`

## Tip 2: CLAUDE.md Configuration
- Initialize with `/init` command
- Create custom rules for project-specific behavior
- Saves time across context resets

## Tip 3: Avoiding Failure Modes
- Add critical implementation rules to CLAUDE.md:
  - Work with production systems and data
  - No isolated testing scripts or workarounds
  - Maintain architectural integrity
  - Production-first mentality

## Tip 4: Context Management
- Use `/compact` command before context falls below 20%
- Proactive resets maintain efficiency

## Tip 5: Division of Labor
- Establish clear boundaries between human and AI tasks
- Reserve GitHub commits for meaningful human interventions
- Use AI to accelerate original ideas, not replace them

## Tip 6: Experiment and Enjoy
- Discover interesting applications that align with your interests
- Pivot early and often to find what works best
- Focus on tools that deliver desired results

# Working with MCP Servers

- Model Context Protocol servers extend AI capabilities
- Configuration varies by interface (Claude Desktop, Cline, Cursor)
- Two primary use cases:
  1. Access information beyond training data
  2. Interact with external services

# Recommended MCP Servers

- Easy installation via Claude Code or JSON config
- Optional specialized search tools in unofficial versions
- GitHub: https://github.com/ppl-ai/modelcontextprotocol

<details>
<summary>Installation Commands</summary>

Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add perplexity-ask npx -- -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-perplexity-ask \
  -e PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

.json configuration:
```json
"perplexity-ask": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-perplexity-ask"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
```
</details>

## Firecrawl
- Extracts text content from websites

# MCP Directories & Sandboxes

- Test MCP tools before installation:
  - https://mcp.so/
  - https://glama.ai
- Sandboxes provide safe testing environments

## OpenAI + MCP Integration

- Fork enabling MCP servers with OpenAI Agents SDK: 
  - https://github.com/lastmile-ai/openai-agents-mcp
- Demonstrates competitive environment in AI tooling

# Challenges and Opportunities

Three key organizational challenges:

1. Context management
2. Fine-tuning datasets
3. Continuous improvement and internal benchmarks

## Context Management Challenge
- Providing specific context without token bloat
- Creating specialized agents as context-aware MCP servers
- Goal: retrieve information efficiently without context overhead
- Building collaborative knowledge systems for shared insights

## Architecture and Applications
- Knowledge acquisition, organization, and synthesis layers
- Cognitive processing and application interfaces
- Voice use cases: meeting assistants and brainstorming

## Opportunity: Test-Driven Problem Solving
- Design tests that define successful outcomes for our workflows
- Create guardrails and handoffs in agentic workflows
- Scale solution discovery without bottlenecks

## Fine-tuning and Progress
- Creating high-quality synthetic datasets
- MCP servers that build fine-tuning datasets from workflows
- Integration with knowledge graphs for long-term memory

## Continuous Improvement
- Developing internal benchmarks for relevant problems
- Capturing and leveraging daily data generation
- Memory layers via MCP servers

# Note Taking Approaches

## Personal Work Notes
- Use Obsidian-compatible formats
- Create relations between notes for better navigation
- Goal: instant access to historical information with minimal overhead

## Personal Method
- Daily notes with infinite scroll and calendar view
- Entity references using [[entity]] syntax
- Hierarchical structure with backlinks
- Targeted search capabilities
- LLM-assisted information retrieval

## Organizational Notes
- Record important meetings for perfect recall
- Save and process meeting transcripts (TimeOS recommended)
- Integrate with company knowledge base (Zapier automation)
- Make knowledge available via LLM interface
- Build competitive advantage through institutional memory

# Workflow Adaptations and Agents

- Enhance existing workflows rather than replacing them
- Create agents as single Python script plugins for MCP tools
- Maximize reusability and integration options

# Remaining Agenda

Next: floor to Chris or anyone else who has anything to share or add to the discussion

Final 15 minutes: 
- strategize as a group around our stack/frameworks/workflows
-
